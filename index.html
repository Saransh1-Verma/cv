    <p>Ram Ki Paidi is the attractive bathing ghat built for the convenience of multitude of Ram devotees to have a sacred bath in holy Sarayu waters. Ram ki Paidi was constructed during 1984 near Nayaghat on the banks of river Sarayu in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. Here we find number of ghats, which are crowded during festival days and in other days in normal number of devotees taking bath to wash of their sins. That means Sarayu would take their sins and while so purifying them she becomes impure for getting all their sins to become a greater sinner and ultimately carries it to the sea to make the sea water more Salter than what it is.</p>
    <p>These series of bathing ghats (25) are located near the bridge on Ayodhya and Gorakpur high way at a distance of 3km from Ayodhya railway station. The Ram ki Paidi runs from the said bridge upto Laxman ghat. The beautiful garden and the reservoir are an added attraction to this place</p>

        <p>The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.</p>

            <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.

                The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.
                
            </p><p>On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.
                
                The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.</p>

                <p>The perimeter of the building is circular, with 144 columns on the outside. At the centre of the building is the circular Central Chamber, and surrounding this Chamber are three semicircular halls that were constructed for the sessions of the Chamber of Princes (now used as the Library Hall), the State Council (now used for the Rajya Sabha),The upper and the second house of parliament is the Rajya Sabha. The members of Rajya Sabha are indirectly elected. The Rajya Sabha gives representation to 28 states and 9 union territories in India. Thus, members of Rajya Sabha work as representatives of the constituent states.and the Central Legislative Assembly (now used for the Lok Sabha)The lok sabha is the lower and the first house of parliament of India. Lok Sabha is the house of representatives directly elected by the people. Hence, the Lok Sabha is called the first house. The member of Lok Sabha are elected directly by the people from the territorial constituencies the tenure of Lok Sabha is of five years. The election take place after every five years. These elections are known as General election. The parliament is surrounded by large gardens and the perimeter is fenced off by sandstone railings (jali).[5]

                    Some sources speculate that the design of the building was inspired by the Chausath Yogini temple in Morena.</p>

                   <p>The presiding image of Kedarnath in the form of lingam is of irregular shape with a pedestal 3.6 m (12 ft) in circumference and 3.6 m (12 ft) in height. There is a small pillared hall in front of the temple, that has images of Parvati and of the five Pandava princes. There are four temples around Kedarnath itself, namely- Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar and Kalpeshwar which form the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites.[17] The first hall inside Kedarnath Temple contains statues of the five Pandava brothers, Krishna, Nandi, the vehicle of Shiva and Virabhadra, one of the guards of Shiva. Statues of Draupadi and other deities are also installed in the main hall.[1] An unusual feature of the temple is the head of a man carved in the triangular stone lingam. Such a head is seen carved in another temple nearby constructed on the site where the marriage of Shiva and Parvati was held. Adi Shankara was believed to have revived this temple, along with Badrinath and other temples of Uttarakhand; he is believed to have attained Mahasamadhi at Kedarnath. Behind the temple is the samādhi mandir of Adi Sankara</p>

                        <p>Har Ki Pauri is a famous ghat on the banks of the Ganges in Haridwar in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. This revered place is the major landmark of the holy city of Haridwar. Literally, "Har" means "God", "Ki" means " 's " and "Pauri" means "steps". Lord Vishnu is believed to have visited the Brahmakund in Har Ki Pauri in the Vedic times.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that it is precise spot where the Ganges leaves the mountains and enters the plains. The ghat is on the west bank of Ganges canal through which the Ganges is diverted just to the north. Har Ki Pauri is also the area where thousands of pilgrims converge and the festivities commence during the Kumbha Mela, which takes place every twelve years, and the Ardh Kumbh Mela, which takes place every six years and the Punjabi festival of Vaisakhi, a harvest festival occurring every year in the month of April.</p>
